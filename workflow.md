# Website Feedback Automation with Agent.AI and Google Sheets

This project automates the process of analyzing websites and providing actionable feedback using the **Agent.AI** platform. It integrates **Google Sheets** to fetch website data, interacts with the **Agent.AI** bot via a webhook, and updates the sheet with insights and suggestions. The final output can also be used to send personalized emails to clients via GMass.

## **What This Project Does**

1. **Fetches Data from Google Sheets**:
   - Retrieves rows from a Google Sheet with information like the client’s name, company, email, and website.
   - Example sheet data:
     | Fname | Lname   | Title | Company       | Website                 | Competitors | Specific Result | Feedback Points |
     |-------|---------|-------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
     | John  | Doe     | CEO   | TechInnovate  | `www.techinnovate.com` |             |                 |                 |

2. **Processes Website Data**:
   - The script sends the website URL to the **Agent.AI bot** (`https://agent.ai/agent/website_feedback_bot`) via a webhook.
   - The bot:
     - Analyzes the website's homepage for usability, navigation, and design insights.
     - Uses **GPT-4 Vision** to review a screenshot of the website and suggest visual improvements.
     - Generates specific actionable feedback points and identifies competitors.

3. **Normalizes Website URL**:
   - Converts URLs into a standardized format (`https://www.example.com`) using the `normalizeDomain` utility function.
   - Handles cases like `example.com`, `http://example.com`, and `www.example.com`.

4. **Updates Google Sheets**:
   - The script updates specific columns in the sheet:
     - **Competitors**: Competitor names generated by the bot.
     - **Specific Result**: Outcomes like "modernized design, improved navigation."
     - **Specific Benefit**: Tangible benefits like "a website that builds trust."
     - **Feedback Points**: Three actionable feedback points, such as:
       1. "Improve website navigation."
       2. "Enhance visual appeal."
       3. "Strengthen call-to-action clarity."

5. **Sends Personalized Emails**:
   - After updating the sheet, the script prepares email templates using **GMass** or any email tool, personalizing the message with the generated data.

## **How the Workflow Works**

### 1. **Fetching Data**
- The script reads the data from Google Sheets using the `googleapis` library.
- It filters rows where `Competitors` are empty and `Website` is available.

### 2. **Processing Websites**
- For each website:
  - The `normalizeDomain` utility ensures the URL is formatted correctly.
  - The formatted URL is sent to the **Agent.AI webhook**.
  - The bot processes the website and returns:
    - **Competitors**: Example, `"FutureTech Innovations and Innovators Ltd."`
    - **Feedback Points**: Example, `["Improve navigation", "Modernize design", "Add better CTAs"]`
    - **Specific Result**: Example, `"modernized design, improved navigation"`
    - **Specific Benefit**: Example, `"a website that builds trust"`

### 3. **Updating Sheets**
- The script updates columns in Google Sheets for each processed website:
  - **Competitors**: Competitor names.
  - **Specific Result**: A concise result statement.
  - **Specific Benefit**: Tangible benefits for the client.
  - **Feedback Points**: Three actionable feedback points.

### 4. **Generating Email Templates**
- A personalized email is prepared using the following data:
  - Client’s name and company.
  - Feedback and improvement suggestions.
  - Competitors and the unique benefit they can gain.
